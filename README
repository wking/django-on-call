If there's somthing strange in your Django_ app, who you gonna call?
The django-on-call app helps your users figure that out, pointing them
to one of your on-call sysadmins.  The admins can work out an on-call
schedule among themselves, by posting a Python statement to the
database (we're all consenting adults), and the view page will direct
users to the appropriate on-call individual.
